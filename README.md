# Thyroid Status Classification (Rule-Based)

This mini project implements a simple rule-based system in Python to classify thyroid conditions using laboratory test values.

## Features
- Input patient data (Age, TSH, FT3, FT4)
- Classifies patients into:
  - Normal
  - Hypothyroid
  - Hyperthyroid
  - Uncertain
- Uses clinical threshold-based decision logic
- No external libraries used

## Motivation
This project was developed to strengthen fundamental programming skills and decision logic before applying machine learning models in medical applications.

## Technologies
- Python (Core)
- Conditional logic
- Lists and Dictionaries

## Future Work
- Convert rule-based logic into a Decision Tree model
- Apply machine learning using scikit-learn
- Evaluate model performance
